A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game framework

###Background
The motivation behind this project derives from a mobile application developed as part of a Master's degree. The application was commissioned by the Global Foundation for the Elimination of Domestic Violence (GFEDV) in order to promote the issues surrounding domestic violence (DV). A blog describing its development process can be found [here](http://eliminationofdv.wordpress.com).

In the app, the user participates in several scenarios by making decisions that influence their outcomes. All of these scenarios revolve around characters who are going through some form of DV. By having an investment in the outcome of the character's situation, it was hoped that the user would gain a greater awareness of the issues surrounding DV. Although the application did not reach general availability, the client was satisfied with the final product.

###Objectives
The core concept of the application was the timed interactions between the user and the scenario's actors. The purpose of creating this framework is to build on this, and simplify the creation of such interactions for more general use.
